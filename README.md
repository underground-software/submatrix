# submatrix

This repository implements a container to host a matrix server
running the synapse implementation that federates with a single
parent server.

The purpose of this container is to form a part of the syzygy/orbit
project to serve as the communication hub for instruction using KDLP
curriculum modules, such as the Introduction to Linux Kernel Development
college course.
